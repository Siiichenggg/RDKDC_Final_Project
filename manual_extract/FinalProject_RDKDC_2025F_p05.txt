                     Start and Target Locations
                     The start and target locations will be specified near the surface. If you are using a pen-gripper, you must
                     figure out the correct rigid body transformation between the “tool0” frame and the “pen tip” frame attached
                     to the tip of the pen gripper using the geometry shown in Fig. 4a. It will be a challenge to figure out the
                     appropriate rigid body transformation to where the gripper is actually located. Keeping this in mind, you
                     may have to adjust the thresholds on your control algorithms to achieve accurate placement. You must test
                     your code in the RVIZ or MATLAB simulations first before running on the real robot. This can also be a
                     challenge because the start and target locations in the final demonstration could be anywhere on the table,
                     i.e., white board/cube could be anywhere on the table (of course they will be reasonable and well within the
                     workspace). Hence, you need to test your code in RVIZ and MATLAB, for which you can use the following
                     sample start and target frames. These are also shown in Figure 6:
                                                                                                                       
                                                           0    −1      0    0.25                  0     −1     0    0.40
                                                                                                                       
                                                          −1     0      0    0.60                 −1      0     0    0.45
                                               g    =                            ; g       =                           
                                                 st1                                   st2                             
                                                           0     0    −1 0.22                      0      0    −1 0.22
                                                           0     0      0      1                   0      0     0      1
                     Of course, you can change these positions as necessary.                  These frames g          and g       are the inputs to
                                                                                                                 st1         st2
                     “urInvKin.m” function, which are transformations between the “base link” and “tool0” frames. Note that
                     the start and target frames shown in Fig. 6 are NOT for the “pen tip” frame which is to be used in the
                     project task. You must figure out the rigid body transformation between the “tool0” frame and the “pen tip”
                     frame.
                     Hint: In the course, you have learned how to compound transformations. To get the position of the pen tip,
                     you must compound the transform between the “tool0” and “pen tip” frames with the forward kinematics
                     of the robot to get the “base link” to “tool0” transform. Likewise, when using the “ur5InvKin.m” function,
                     you must convert your “base link” to “pen tip” transform to a “base link” to “tool0” transform as this is
                     what the function expects.

                     Debug your program with these frames in RVIZ before attempting to run the real UR5.
                     Other Hints
                        1. You should have a process, or controlled procedure for achieving the desired “push-and-place” perfor-
                            mance.
