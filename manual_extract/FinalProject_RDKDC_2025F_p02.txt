                              All of which will be somewhere on the lab table inside the workspace of the UR5(e). Note that (1) is to
                              be taught. However, (2) should be computed based on the last location, denoted as (end) in
                              Fig. 1, of the robot trajectory to push the cube. This means that you will have to compute the end
                              points of the second line in your code so that the robot automatically complete the pick-and-draw task. You
                              have already implemented code to drive the robot to a given position and orientation (pose) in Cartesian
                              space using Resolved Rate Control. Now you need to develop a complete program that moves the robot
                              end-effector from the start location to the stop location using the UR5(e).
